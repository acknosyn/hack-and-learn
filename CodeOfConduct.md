# Community Code Of Conduct

## Introduction

* Diversity and inclusion make the Hack and Learn community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand
* Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic
* This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members

## Expected Behavior

* Be welcoming
* Be kind
* Look out for each other

## Unacceptable Behavior

* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature
  * Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms
  * Do not show disrespect towards others (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes)
* Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person). Please read the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) for how we interpret harassment
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop
